# 💥 Esports AI Website 💥

Yo yo, welcome to the Gasky Zone — the wildest AI corner of the internet where logic took a vacation and chaos runs the show 😎🔥

Nobody really knows who coded this beast — probably an AI on caffeine overdose mixed with pure “IDGAF” energy. ☕🤖

⚙️ About

This site? Straight-up AI madness.
Built using ChatGPT, duct tape, and pure dumb luck.
It’s messy, glitchy, and proudly unoptimized — just how legends are made. 💀💻

👑 Owner

Meet the brains (and chaos) behind the mess — Yadav.dev and End.og 🧠💣
They don’t follow the rules, they rewrite ’em.
Codin’ like it’s a street fight, dropping leaks like mixtapes, and flexin’ bugs like badges of honor. 💥

If it’s broken — it’s probably intentional. If it works — that’s just luck, bro. 😂

📝 Notes

Yeah, the code’s a certified dumpster fire 🔥 — but hey, it runs (kinda).
Call it artificial stupidity or digital chaos, whatever suits your vibe.

Mess with it, break it, roast it — just don’t DM us crying when it crashes 😭


---

Use it, vibe with it, remix it — just keep it legal, fam.
Peace out ✌️💻
